                <p>My name is Brad Pitt. I am an actor from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now live in Los Angeles like every other actor. <br> <br>
    
                    I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy and drama. I am known for playing charismatic male leads, 
                    and have been described as the world's most attractive man by several media outlets. Nowadays I prefer subtler roles, including 
                    those where I play a father figure, which I am to my six children. <br> <br>
                    Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with my own production company Plan B Entertainment, of which I am the CEO. 
                    In my spare time, I enjoy philantropy, architecture, and skateboarding. In my work with the Make It Right Foundation, I get to combine at least two of these 
                    interestsâ€”sometimes all three!                </p>
